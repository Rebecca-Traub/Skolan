              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>I led this project as a part of my internship at Eliq, which specializes in building software solutions for utility companies. During user testing and ideation sessions, I collaborated with their resident UX designer, Mikael Erlandsson.</p>

            <section class="col">
              <h4>The project</h4>
              <p>The new AI Energy Advisor feature is an MVP that needs to be user tested before it is launched. The challenge was to adapt it so that users could understand its benefits while also making it fun and enjoyable to use.</p>

              <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
              <p>I carried out a competitive analysis to better understand the competitors, industry trends and to identify the feature's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
              <p>The results were:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Clear idea for how to stand out from the competition</li>
                <li>Gamification ideas</li>
                <li>Understaning of the type of design solution that the users are already accustomed to</li>
               </ul>

              <h4>Usability testing and interviewing</h4>
              <p>In order to determine where the current design is lacking, I created a manual consisting of tasks and questions I would ask the users before and after the usability test.</p>
              <p>Issues identified during user testing:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>When users click on “Mark as done” there is no system feedback</li>
                <li>Uncertain meaning of "Discard" section</li>
                <li>A lot of unstructured text inside the screen “Savings card”</li>
                <li>Users missed the Energy Advisor card on home screen because of the UX copy and card design</li>
                <li>Users want to know the total amount of savings achieved</li>

              <h4>Ideating</h4>
              <p>To organize large sets of ideas and problems the users had into clusters, I chose an affinity diagramming workshop.</p>
              <p>It resulted in these “How might we” statements:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Give users feedback so they understand what happens when they click on buttons.</li>
                <li>Reduce scroll and text overload so users can get a better overview</li>
                <li>Make the home tips card more visible </li>
                <li>Show the user it’s current progress to inspire them to use the feature</li>
               </ul>
               <p>To identify the most important problems, I used a prioritization matrix (Value for users/Easy and fast to implement).</p>

              <h4>Wireframeing</h4>
              <p>By leveraging existing mental models, I designed different solutions where the user can focus on its task rather than on learning new models (Jakob’s law).</p>
              <p>Design suggestions for the “How might we” statements:</p>

              <br>
              <ol>
                <li>Animations that provide users with the appropriate feedback.
                <li>Organized and minimized information on screens, removed "Discard" from main menu to reduce cognitive overload.</li>
                <li>Easily noticeable home screen card design with a clear CTA.</li>
                <li>Making use fun by adding gamification elements such as visual progress updates</li>

              <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
              <p>The designs were influenced by my research on human-machine interaction. The decisions I made were based on established best practices.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="col">
              <br>
              <p>The next step for this project would be to perform another set of usability tests, this time on the new designs, in order to validate them. This is also my suggestion to the Eliq team that is continuing to work on this feature.</p>
